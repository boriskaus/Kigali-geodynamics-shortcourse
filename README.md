### Getting started
We will regularly update these notes and upload some of the input scripts for the simulations. The easiest way to get started is to clone this repository
```bash
$git clone https://github.com/boriskaus/Kigali-geodynamics-shortcourse .
```
Alternatively, you can download the zip file.
